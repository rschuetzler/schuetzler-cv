\section*{Research Interests}

My research interests center around users' adaptation and use of novel
communication technology. My primary research focuses on human interaction with
embodied conversational agents and chat bots, and the influence of those chat
bots on users' feelings and behavior toward those systems. I also study users'
adaptation to intelligent systems designed to detect deception. I am interested
to learn how people adapt their behavior, either consciously or unconsciously,
as they interact with novel systems. I focus on a design science methodology
following the Last Research Mile philosophy. Much of my research involves
laboratory experiments.

\section*{Teaching}

% \subsection*{Teaching Philosophy}
% My teaching is centered around one principle: I want students to love the
% material I teach in the class. I start each semester telling my students just
% that. I tell them that if they don't love them, I want them to at least like
% it; and if not like it, then at least understand it. In order to foster that
% attitude, I believe in creating an interactive classroom where I am not the only
% one instructing. I design my class in a way to allow students to contribute and
% teach each other. I also fully admit to my students that I do not know
% everything, and show my own love of the material by seeking answers to student
% questions that stump me during class.\\

% My in-class activities are centered around ensuring that students learn,
% understand, and apply their knowledge. Regular hands-on activities and in-class
% small group activities help students solidify their knowledge in a way that my
% lecturing cannot. In any way possible, I strive to give students the basic
% knowledge that they need in order to teach themselves. There is not enough time
% in a semester, or in an entire university education, to learn everything one
% must know in this world of ever-advancing technology. So I see my role as giving
% students the basic pieces that they can later put together in new and exciting
% ways.

% I believe that the purpose of a university education is to teach students how to
% think and how to learn. With the ever-changing technological landscape, the need
% to memorize information is nearly nonexistent. As such, my instruction focuses
% on giving students the hands-on experience and skills that they could not easily
% Google in the future. I believe in equipping students with a level of knowledge
% and understanding of course topics so they can converse intelligently and
% understand reference material easily available on the web.\\

% My course instruction centers on class participation and understanding. When
% possible I bring hands-on lab exercises and learning activities to aid students
% in internalizing course material.

\begin{quote}
  I appreciated your passion and it encouraged me to work harder and study better for this
  course\ldots I fully digested the information you presented to us. After completing this
  course, I am seriously considering spending more time in the areas you taught us because
  I have found a curiosity for the area I did not imagine before.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  I really enjoy class. The way the material has been amplified with your own knowledge
  and the way the slides are structured really help me to pay attention, take notes, and
  tell myself "Ooo, that's something I want to put down here. That's important."
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  Great teacher, made everything very easy to understand. Made class interesting and
  fun. Kept everyone engaged in learning.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  I really enjoyed that Ryan truly cared if his students understood what was going on and
  comprehended the material.
